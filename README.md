# Tangible Sounds

Audio-visualization program that creates a tangible experience of interacting with audio, visually.

## Summary

This program utilizes a laptop connected to a MIDI controller to construct a visual design based on a simple algorithm. I will likely be using the code from Casey Reas that I have used in the previous project. Instead, I will add more variables to the code that allow it to construct different patterns for different notes that correspond with the notes inputted by the user pressing on the keyboard.

Because the MIDI keyboard delivers two variables, velocity and note(+octave), they will both affect two variables in the code that determine the opacity and size (velocity) as well as location on the x-axis (note+octave). The final presentation would consist simply of a keyboard placed in front of a TV screen or projector which is connected to the laptop.

In addition, I'd like to incorporate an API that would control a third variable (other than size, opacity, or location). I haven't decided what specifically, but I would like to choose something that provides an extra layer of meaning to the experience beyond just visualizing notes that are being played to a song.

## Component Parts

The project consists of laptop + MIDI keyboard + Processing + external display.

MIDI keyboard is plugged into laptop via a printer cable + USB-C adapter. External display is plugged into laptop via HDMI cable + USB-C adapter.

## When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:

- Week 2: Connect the velocity and note values to circles that coincide with the keys
- Week 3:
- Week 4: Present!
